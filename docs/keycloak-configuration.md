# Keycloak Identity and Access Management

## Keycloak Online configuration

[Keycloak installation](keycloak-installation.md) needs to be completed.

### Create a realm for homekube

Why creating a realm ? Realms in terms of Keycloak wording are fully seperated configuration areas.
This tutorial will guide through all the required configuration steps.

Click on the ``Create realm`` button top left

The realm name should be lower case e.g. ``homekube``. Then click ``Create``   

![](/docs/images/keycloak//12-create-realm.png)

Go to the newly created realms settings page under ``General`` tab

### Create a client for homekube

This client is the service that other apps are talking to when they request user authentication.

![](/docs/images/keycloak//20-create-client.png)
#### Step 1
Enter the Client ID. All apps / services that request authentication must be configured to talk to this client.
The ${HOMEKUBE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID} is a reference to this client.  

![](/docs/images/keycloak//21-create-client.png)
#### Step 2

Enable **authentication** and **authorization** and authentication flow is **Standard flow** and **Direct access grants**.

#### Step 3
Allowing all redirect urls for simplicity and Web origins.

#### Finish client setup

Select the newly created ``homekube-client`` from the list and finsh the setup. The important part is 
the client secret. This is generated by keycloak and needs to be copied into the ${HOMEKUBE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET} of your environment vars file.

### Creating users
- **admin-user** will be granted all permissions to create/read/update/delete any objects of the installation. Its password **MUST** be kept secret for obvious reasons.
- **simple-user** will be granted read permissions on most objects.  
- **demo** will be allowed to see namespaces and pods and logs.

Users credentials will be set later.

Repeat this step for the 3 users above.

### Creating groups

Permissions will be assigned on a group level so later we could assign additional users to groups.

- **admins** have administration permissions and joined with ``admin-user``
- **readonly** will be assigned to ``simple-users`` and have read permissions on most objects
- **demo** have very restricted permissions e.g. namespaces, pods and logs adn assigned to ``demo``

Repeat the group creation steps until the ``Group` menu looks like this

![](/docs/images/keycloak//42-create-groups.png)

### Users joining groups

Open the 3 user creation forms and join groups as outlined above.
Also enter email addresses for all users and deselect the ``Temporary`` boolean switch. 
Select ``Email verified`` to true else the user will be untrusted later.

![](/docs/images/keycloak//45-users-created.png)

### Set users credentials

Set all user credentials in this step. 
![](/docs/images/keycloak//50-set-credentials.png)

Enter a password for ``admin-user`` and keep it secret.
Repeat for ``demo`` user. For compliance with this documentation you might want to set the password to ``demo``
Same with ``simple-user`` which password should be set to the ``${HOMEKUBE_KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD}``

### Create a client scope
